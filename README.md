# Figma project
**This is my first time using Figma , it was really fun. Without further ado let's see how I accomplished it**
_I used some of my google searching skills to take a look on some ideas_
_I started with wireframing the design and at first I put my dreams up_ _it was for professional users and it didn't really work for mich_
*Then I've put some colors and mockup my wireframe to make it look cool and easy on eyes of client*
**The last step** _was about connect pages together and prototype_
# That's all !
